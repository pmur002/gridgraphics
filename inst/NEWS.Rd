\section{Changes in version 0.5-0}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{grid.echo()} now supports \code{stats::plot.hclust()} 
    \item Fix for \code{grid.echo.function()} when start with
    no devices open
    (it was opening an extra device on exit).
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.4-2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Protection against \code{NA} labels in text (so that they do not get
    echoed as "NA").

    NOTE that his will NOT be fixed in \pkg{grid} because some existing
    packages relies on that \pkg{grid} behaviour.

    \item Protection against \code{NULL} labels in text (so that
    \pkg{grid} does not complain about them).

    Reported by Patrick Schratz.
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.4-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Allow install on R below 3.6.0 (even if the echo results are
    not as good)
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.4-0}{
  \itemize{
    \item New function \code{echoGrob()}.

    \item Echoing \code{persp()} now respects \code{cex.axis} setting
    (for size of tick labels).

    \item Fixup for axis() when scale is reversed.

    \item Fixes for \code{C_axis()} (and \code{GMtext()}) to use
    \code{graphics::grconvertX()} (and \code{graphics::grconvertY}) to
    calculate length
    of tick marks and placement of tick labels.  This is to respond
    correctly to \code{par()} changes AFTER \code{plot()}, but
    before \code{axis()} (either via explicit \code{par()} calls,
    or implicitly when functions like \code{dotchart()} reset
    \code{par()} internally).

    These changes make use of new \code{deviceLoc()} function
    and updated \code{grconvertX()} and \code{grconvertY()} functions
    in R 3.6.0.
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.3-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Improved \code{currentPar()} function so that it behaves more like
    the graphics engine's \code{ProcessInlinePars()}.  The main point is that
    setting a \code{par()} parameter in a high-level function is allowed to
    specify multiple values for the setting (whereas setting via
    \code{par()} itself only allows a single value per parameter setting).
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.3-0}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added \pkg{magick} and \pkg{pdftools} as (Suggests)
    dependencies, to provide better
    and more stable support for \code{plotdiff()}.

    \item Fixed clipping (of main contour region) bug for echoing
    \code{filled.contour()}. 
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.2-2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added \code{device} argument to \code{grid.echo()}
    so that user can specify a \dQuote{working device}.  This
    is an in-memory PDF device by default, but that can have
    problems with fonts.  Suggested by Claus Wilke.

    \item Added capture of font family when echoing persp() plots.
    Reported by Claus Wilke.

    \item Added names for grobs from echoing \code{persp()} and
    \code{filled.contour()}.

    \item Fix for echoing correct \code{font} settings in \code{axis()}
    and \code{persp()}. Reported by Claus Wilke.

    \item Attempt to survive errors during echoing (like
    "figure margins too large") more elegantly

  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.2-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed bug when echoing scatter plot with ZERO points in it.
    Reported by github user zxzb
    \url{https://github.com/pmur002/gridgraphics/issues/9}
    
    \item Made plotdiff() more robust to unexpected output from
    ImageMagick's compare.  Reported by Brian Ripley.
    
    \item Added Zhijian (Jason) Wen as package author (it was he
    who contributed the \code{persp()} and \code{filled.contour()}
    support).
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.2}{
    \itemize{
        \item \code{grid.echo()} now supports \code{persp()} and 
        \code{filled.contour()}
      }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.1-5}{
  \itemize{
    \item Changed stop() to warning() when call grid.echo() with
    empty \dQuote{recordedplot} (suggested by Jonathon Godfrey).
    \item Fixed examples for \code{grid.echo()}
    (patch by Josh O'Brien).
    \item More robust Windows support for \code{plotdiff()} and
    \code{plotcompare()} (patch by Josh O'Brien).
    \item Added defence against \code{axis(line=)} specification
    of length greater than 1 (reported by Jimmy Oh).
    \item Added explicit handling of \code{C_layout()},
    though handling does nothing (reported by Jimmy Oh).
    \item Fixed drawing of ticks for \code{axis(at=)} when
    \code{at} exceeds range of axis scale.  The ticks outside
    the axis scale range are now correctly clipped
    (reported by Jimmy Oh).
    \item Future-proofed test script for \code{hist.POSIXt()}
    (so that the addition of new leap seconds does not generate errors
    about \code{breaks} not spanning the range of the data).
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.1-4}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added defence against \code{NA} text values in call to
    \code{title()}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.1-3}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added defence against code sending in NULL values in \code{par()}
    settings (e.g., \pkg{sp} does this with the \code{xpd} setting).
    These \code{par()} settings are ignored (to match internal
    \pkg{graphics} C code behaviour).
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.1-2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed documentation of first argument in \code{grid.echo()}
    (it can be a function, not an expression).
    
    \item Added better checking in plotdiff() for existence of
    \code{convert} and \code{compare} tools and for recent-enough
    version of R (to be able to perform the strict check for
    differences).
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.1-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item First public release of \pkg{gridGraphics} package.
  }
}
